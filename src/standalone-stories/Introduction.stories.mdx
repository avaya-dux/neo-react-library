# Welcome to the Neo React Library Storybook

Here you will find a collection of stories to help you get started with the Neo React Library. If you are unfamiliar with Storybook, [this is a short description of what it is and how to navigate it](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/browse-stories).

You can browse through the stories or use the search bar to find a specific one. You can jump to the search bar at any time by pressing the **/** (slash) key on your keyboard.

## Quick Start

If you want to jump right in, you can add the Neo CSS+React Libraries to your app via:

<code>npm i @avaya/neo-react @avaya/neo</code>

or

<code>yarn add @avaya/neo-react @avaya/neo</code>

And then wrapping your app in our [Theme Provider](/story/components-neo-theme-provider--default).
